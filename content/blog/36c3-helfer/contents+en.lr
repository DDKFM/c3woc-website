But for this I need your help. I have - together with the [OIO](https://oio.social) pulled up a helper system to coordinate us:

<a class="primary special extra button" href="https://36c3.einhornsystem.de">einhornsystem.de</a>

The idea is to coordinate us over here and to be able to press hardworking unicorns also a thank you in the hand.
So there is for hardworking unicorns a Pl√ºsh unicorn as a thank you. More details will be found soon in the unicorn system.

By the way, L3D is still looking for people to help him organize the C3WOC!

**Hygiene instruction?**

A hygiene instruction as a unicorn is of course advantageous to have. However, a prudent handling of food and an awareness of hygiene is much more important than a paper that certifies that you can.
For more information about hygiene please contact [C3GELB](https://twitter.com/@c3gelb).
